Along the way I went back to college for a BA in Marketing just for good measure.\nCurrently I'm contracting as a UI Web Developer at T-Mobile. This position's taught me a lot about enterprise-level e-commerce, maintaining .NET and JAVA environments, and coordinating efforts with offshore developers.",
